<br>This is the main repository for the pedagogical aspects of the course; it lives within a GitHub organization that also hosts the practical coding projects completed for the course. <br>

#### some git tips for those who want them:
to start a local version<br>
`cd to_the_parent_folder_on_your_local`<br>
`git clone url_you_copied_github_and_pasted_here`<br>
<br>
to sync what is new on the remote (GitHub) to your local computer<br>
`git pull` <br>
<br>
to add a change you made to a repository<br>
`cd to_the_folder_on_your_local`<br>
`git add *` or `git add name_of_file_that_was_added_or_modified.filename`<br>
`git commit -m "message about what changed"`<br>
`git push`<br>

to clone a private repository you made:<br>
`git clone https://username@github.com/username/repo_name`<br>
where "username" is your github username. so for `silver-waffle` which we created in class, dan would do:<br>
`git clone https://danieljdenman@github.com/CU-NRSC-7657/silver-waffle.git`<br>
you can then authenticate with your password and pull away<br>
